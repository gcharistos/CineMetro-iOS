"filmFestival" = "The Thessaloniki International Film Festival is the top film festival of South Eastern Europe, the presentation platform for the year's Greek productions, and the primary and oldest festival in the Balkans for the creations of emerging film makers from all over the world. Founded in 1960 as the Week of Greek Cinema, it became international in 1992, including a Competition Section for feature length films by emerging directors presenting their first or second film.Since then, the Thessaloniki International Film Festival, constantly evolving, has claimed and achieved a constantly increasing international scope, presenting the most groundbreaking independent productions from the entire world, and developing activities for international film industry professionals. Since the mid 1990s, the Thessaloniki International Film Festival, going beyond the borders set for decades by its centerpiece November edition, has become an organization with continuously increasing cultural activities throughout the year.Through its new form and activities, the Thessaloniki International Film Festival has established close collaborations with various local, national, regional and international film institutions, cultural, educational and social organizations, as well as embassies and cultural agencies from other countries." ;
